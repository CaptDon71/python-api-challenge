# python-api-challenge
Module 6 Challenge - This project contains two key deliverables, both located within the /WeatherPy/ directory:

**WeatherPy Analysis**
File Path: /WeatherPy/WeatherPy.ipynb
Description: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and analysis for generating weather data based on random city coordinates. It includes the steps for collecting weather data from an API, performing data cleaning, and visualizing weather trends.

**VacationPy Analysis**
File Path: /WeatherPy/VacationPy.ipynb
Description: This Jupyter Notebook builds upon the weather data from WeatherPy to create a vacation map. It uses weather conditions and geographic coordinates to identify ideal vacation locations and generates a map displaying hotels in those areas.
Both deliverables can be opened in a Jupyter environment to explore the code and results.
